# Employee Management Application (Full Stack Spring Boot and React JS)

Welcome to the Employee Management Application repository! This project is designed to help you manage employee information efficiently using a Full Stack architecture with Spring Boot for the backend and React JS for the frontend.

## Introduction

The Employee Management Application allows users to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee details such as name, email, department, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**

  - Axios (for handling HTTP requests)
  - Bootstrap (for styling)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Configure your MySQL database credentials in the `application.properties` file.
4. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the Spring Boot backend server.
5. The backend server will start running at `http://localhost:9090`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the React development server.
